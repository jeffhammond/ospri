MARPN_RANKS_PER_NODE

Set this to the number of ranks-per-node (rpn) you really want.
If you want 48 rpn, you need to submit your job in 64 rpn.
In general, submit your jobs requesting the next power of two.

MARPN_DEBUG

Turn on debug printing during MPI_Init to see if the split is correct.

MARPN_SLEEP_AND_ABORT

Unused MPI ranks sleep(1B) instead of calling PMPI_Finalize, which
might help with instruction scheduling of those hardware threads.
To exit the job, MPI_Finalize calls PMPI_Abort with exit code 0,
which should behave approximately the same on Blue Gene/Q.
